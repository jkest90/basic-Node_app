1) What is a Node Module?

- A node module allows us to easily export functions that perform specific tasks to other parts of our application.
They allow us to break our application apart into easily manageable organized parts.

2) What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

- Module.exports is an object that allows us to export the methods within it, while exports is simply a reference to that object.

3) Why is using exports recommended?

- Exports is recommended over module.exports because, since it is just a reference, it cannot reassign module.exports, which can cause errors.
